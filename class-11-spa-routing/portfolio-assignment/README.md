# Portfolio Assignment for Class 11 - Single-Page Apps

We converted the blog into a SPA by using the page.js library to capture clicks and execute a function to modify the page, rather than reloading content from a server.

Give your portfolio the same treatment. Update your main nav so that each clickable item is a link to a different url, that is handled by a function as indicated by page.js.

Keep your code organized in a M-V-C structure that isolates data management from presentation layer, from the controller that holds it all together.

If you want the full caabilities of the page.js library, you will need a basic server and package.json file in your app's directory.
